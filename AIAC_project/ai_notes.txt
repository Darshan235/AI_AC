# AI Notes — How AI Helped Build This Frontend

I used AI (VSC GitHub copilot) to create the frontend part of this invoice generator project.  
Here is how AI assisted:

1. Planning the UI
   - AI suggested a minimal interface requiring only one input: customer name.
   - It also proposed features like copy button, new invoice button, and history.

2. Designing the Invoice Format
   - AI helped design a simple algorithm:
     - Extract initials → prefix
     - Add timestamp → uniqueness over time
     - Add 4‑character random string → avoid collisions

3. Writing the Code
   - AI generated:
     - `index.html` layout
     - Clean, modern CSS
     - JavaScript for invoice logic, timestamp creation, prefix extraction, randomness, and UI behavior

4. File Packaging
   - AI automated file generation and zipped the entire project structure.

AI was mainly used to quickly produce clean code and structure the project efficiently, saving development time.
